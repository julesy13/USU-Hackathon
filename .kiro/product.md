# Product Steering: Data App Factory

## Vision
Empower business users at ImaginaryCompany to deploy governed data applications without needing a data engineer. We are combining an AI IDE with a simulated Databricks/AWS environment to allow users to describe their desired app in natural language.

## User Personas

**Primary:** Business Analyst (Non-technical, wants to ask questions in plain English).

## Core Principles


**Self-Service:** The app must be intuitive and conversational.

**Performant:** Dashboards should load quickly with clear visualizations.
